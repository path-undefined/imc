# IM/C â€” A Slightly IMproved C Language

IM/C is a toy language based on C language. It solves severl problems of C language:

1. akward include system and non-existing namespacing support
2. non-existing project management system
3. confusing typing expression
4. relying on macro for generic programming
5. ambigious syntax

Yet still try to keep two main features of C:

1. the manual memory management
2. ability to directly manipulate the memory
3. the minimalist design
